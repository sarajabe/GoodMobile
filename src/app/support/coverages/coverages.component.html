            <p class="smaller">These maps provide a predicted high-level approximation of wireless coverage. There are gaps in coverage that are not shown by this high-level approximation. Actual coverage may <b>differ</b> from map graphics and may be affected by <b>terrain, weather, network changes, foliage, buildings, constructions, signal strength, high-usage periods, customer equipment, </b>& other factors. </p> 
            <p class="smaller">We cannot guarantee coverage. Our coverage maps are not intended to show actual customer performance on the network or future network needs or build requirements inside or outside of existing coverage areas. Coverage maps may include areas served by unaffiliated carriers. Arrangements with these carriers may change from time to time, & coverage is subject to change without notice. Charges will be based on the <b>location of the site receiving and transmitting the call,</b> not the subscriber’s location.</p>
