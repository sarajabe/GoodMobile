    <p class="subtitle">Android version 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and up</p>
    <p class="primary-color-title">First things first.....</p>
    <p>If you just activated your phone, please
      make sure to turn it off and back on. This
      ensures
      your phone will get its first set of programming direct from the towers, and will force
      your phone to register quickly.</p>
    <p class="primary-color-title"> Secondly...</p>
    <p>Important data settings need to be programmed into
      your phone. This is like the
      ‘key to the data portion of the network. Without this, your mobile
      data will not work.</p>
    <p>The following instructions are for most Android devices. While your phone’s menu
      may look different, the information which goes into each of the fields is the same, no
      matter what model device you have. No data connection is necessary when entering
      these settings but a data-capable device is required to surf the web and watch videos
      online.</p>
    <p><b>Phones which are 5G capable require special data settings to be able to use the 5G network. You must also
        turn on 5G
        through your account summary page.</b></p>
